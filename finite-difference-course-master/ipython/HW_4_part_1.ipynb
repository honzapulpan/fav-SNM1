Compare the time required to compute the solution (you may find it useful to use the python package time and the function time.time()). Compare this with the time taken to solve the original system (of three equations) with the same tolerances. You should observe that it is much slower to solve the system that includes $D$, even though the solution is essentially the same. You should also see that the cost of computing the solution doesn't increase much as the tolerance is reduced.
